## Features

### 1. User Authentication & Role Management
   - **Roles and Access**:
     - **Admin**: Full access to all authentication settings and role management.
     - **Manager**: Can manage users within their operations but cannot assign roles.
     - **Operator**: No access to role management or authentication settings.
     - **Viewer**: No access to role management or authentication settings.
   - **How It Works**:
     - Users can register, log in, and authenticate through a secure system.
     - Roles (Admin, Manager, Operator, Viewer) are assigned upon user registration or by an Admin.
     - Each userâ€™s access is restricted based on their role, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive data or features.
     - Admins can modify user roles and permissions to control access across the system.

### 2. Operations Dashboard
   - **Roles and Access**:
     - **Admin**: Full access to view, update, create, and delete operations.
     - **Manager**: Can view, update, and create operations but cannot delete.
     - **Operator**: Can view assigned operations and update their status.
     - **Viewer**: Read-only access to view ongoing and upcoming operations.
   - **How It Works**:
     - Displays all ongoing and upcoming defense operations.
     - Admins and Managers can create and modify operations, specifying important details like start/end dates, resources, and personnel involved.
     - Operators can mark operations as completed or update their status.
     - Operations are grouped by status (Ongoing, Upcoming, Completed) to ensure easy monitoring.
     - A real-time updating system ensures that the dashboard is always current with the latest operation statuses.
     - **Weather Updates**: Weather information (e.g., temperature, humidity, storm warnings) will be displayed on the operations dashboard, integrating real-time weather data relevant to the operation locations.
     - **Location Tracking**: The system will track the real-time location of personnel, resources, and vehicles, which will be displayed directly on the operations dashboard to provide a comprehensive view.

### 3. Resource Management
   - **Roles and Access**:
     - **Admin**: Full access to manage resources (add, update, allocate, and delete).
     - **Manager**: Can allocate and update resources but cannot add or delete.
     - **Operator**: Can view assigned resources and update their status.
     - **Viewer**: Read-only access to view resource details.
   - **How It Works**:
     - Admins and Managers can track and allocate resources such as vehicles, personnel, and equipment.
     - Resources are categorized (e.g., available, in use, maintenance) for easy monitoring.
     - Real-time alerts notify users of resource status changes (e.g., maintenance required).
     - Operators can only interact with resources assigned to their specific operations, ensuring that resources are not overused or misallocated.
     - Resources can be assigned directly to operations based on real-time needs and availability.

### 4. Reports & Analytics
   - **Roles and Access**:
     - **Admin**: Full access to view, generate, and export reports.
     - **Manager**: Can generate and view reports within their scope of operations.
     - **Operator**: Cannot generate or view reports.
     - **Viewer**: Cannot generate or view reports.
   - **How It Works**:
     - Reports can be generated based on operations, resources, and other criteria like date range or resource type.
     - Admins and Managers can view generated reports and export them in formats like CSV or PDF.
     - Analytics include graphical visualizations such as pie charts, bar graphs, and line charts to help users interpret data and performance trends.
     - Reports are automatically generated after certain operations or resource changes, providing real-time insights into operations efficiency and resource utilization.

### 5. Notifications
   - **Roles and Access**:
     - **Admin**: Can configure and send notifications to all users.
     - **Manager**: Can send notifications to users within their scope of operations.
     - **Operator**: Can receive notifications related to assigned operations and resources.
     - **Viewer**: Can receive notifications but cannot send or configure them.
   - **How It Works**:
     - Real-time notifications alert users about critical events (e.g., operation status changes, resource issues).
     - Admins and Managers can configure notification triggers for specific actions (e.g., resource allocation, operation completion).
     - Notifications are sent via email or in-app alerts, and users can customize their preferences for which notifications they receive.
     - Operators receive updates relevant to their assigned operations, while Admins can configure system-wide alerts.
     - **Email Notifications**: Admins can configure automated email alerts for important events or updates regarding operations, resources, or system changes.

### 6. Audit Logs
   - **Roles and Access**:
     - **Admin**: Full access to all audit logs, including search and filter functionalities.
     - **Manager**: Can view audit logs related to operations and resources they manage.
     - **Operator**: Cannot access audit logs.
     - **Viewer**: Cannot access audit logs.
   - **How It Works**:
     - Every action performed by a user (e.g., login, resource allocation, report generation) is logged in the system.
     - Admins have access to a complete audit trail of all actions performed within the system, which can be filtered by user, action type, or time range.
     - Logs include essential information such as timestamp, user details, action performed, and the affected resources or operations.
     - Audit logs ensure transparency, providing a detailed record of every system interaction for compliance, troubleshooting, and security purposes.
